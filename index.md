# Pricing

## Transparent Technology

We use a collection of Microsoft software to set-up your data process that can be accessed and modified by anyone.

#### Setup
A traditional data flow for a program with 3-8 staff runs $3000. Pay this over a year and start using the technology as soon as it's ready. If you're not convinced it's the future, stop paying us with no penalty.

#### Upkeep
We charge $100 monthly for upkeep, small updates, and 1 day support response time. Once your setup is paid off, let us manage it or take it on yourselves. You feeling techie, punk?

#### Monthly Licences
If you're a registered non-profit with techsoup, licences are highly affordable:

A 8 staff team ($2.5/per) with 1 admin account ($30/per) and 2 PowerBI reporting accounts ($3/per) is $54/month.

#### Visualization
Data's more fun when it's seen. We'll make your rebellious internal or public-facing data visualizations for $60/hour, $45 if you use us for upkeep.
