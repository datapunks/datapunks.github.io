# Give your mission some byte

Unique stories need unique data. That's why we make customized data-technology for social-change programs and initiatives.

We undercut the cost and complexity of other data-management solutions by building lightweight technology specifically for your program's workflow.

With accessible data-technology, we capitalize on your staff's intrinsic desire to spread your story.

## The Punk Process

We focus on three data elements:

<h4>Pragmatic Architecture</h4>

<p>Together we'll define data that balances organizational and funder desires with reality and store it in a database that works for you.</p>

<p>Engage your staff with a database that isn't a black box. From internal reports to public mobile-responsive visualizations, your data has never been so exposed.</p>

And we do it with <span style="color: #23eeec;">transparent technology</span>: highly customizable Microsoft software available at a steep non-profit discount. No algorithmic wizardry required. We can even build your organization's capacity to customize and maintain it.

DIY or let us handle it. We charge $125 monthly for 2 hours of IT time, free bug fixes, a response within 24 hours, and discounts on data-visualizations.

#### Monthly Licences

* $2.50 for Team Member (basic staff account)

For a team of 8 expect around $60/month.
