# Give your mission some byte

Unique stories need unique data. That's why we create customized data-systems for social-change missions.

We undercut the cost and complexity of other data-management solutions by building lightweight technology to fit your staff's workflow.

With accessible data, our systems capitalize on staff's intrinsic desire to tell your story.

## The Punk Process

We focus on three key data elements:

<div class="w3-container w3-card-4 spacer-small" style="background: #444851">

<h4>Pragmatic Architecture</h4>

<p>Together we'll define data that balances organizational and funder desires with reality, then store it in a database that works for you.</p>

<h4>Streamlined Collection</h4>

<p>Data shouldn't be a chore. We tailor phone/tablet/browser data entry experiences that skip the clipboard and build habit.</p>

<h4>Loud Visualizations</h4>

<p>Engage staff with a database that isn't a black box. From internal reports to public visualizations, your data has never been so exposed.</p>

</div>

And we do it with <span style="color: #23eeec;">transparent technology</span>: highly customizable Microsoft software available at a steep non-profit discount. No algorithmic wizardry required. We can even build your organization's capacity to customize and maintain it.

You feeling techie, punk?

## Pricing

#### Setup
Small-team data-entry setups can start at $2000 or less. Use the technology as soon as it's ready and pay us monthly over a year. If you're not convinced it's the future, stop payment with no penalty.

#### Upkeep
DIY or let us handle it. Starting at $125 monthly, we offer 2 hours of IT time, free bug fixes, a response within 24 hours, and discounts on data-visualizations.

#### Licences
If you're a registered non-profit with techsoup.org, monthly licences for Microsoft's tech are highly affordable:

* $2.40 for a Team Member licence (basic staff account)
* $35.00 for an Administrative licence (you'll only need one)
* $3.00 for a PowerBI Pro licence (optional - allows for easy sharing of interactive visualizations)

#### Visualization
Data's more fun when it's seen. We'll make your rebellious internal or public-facing visualizations for $60/hour, $40 if you use us for upkeep.

Data visualizations are more than just report graphs. <a href="http://boylestreet.org/data" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline; color:#23eeec;">This live data-visualization project</a> we completed with Boyle Street Community Services is advocacy in action.
