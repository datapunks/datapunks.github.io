# Unique stories need unique data.

That's why we make customized data-technology for social change initiatives.

We undercut the cost and complexity of other data-management solutions by building lightweight technology specifically for your program's workflow.

With data that's easy to enter and view, we capitalize on your staff's intrinsic desire to spread your story.

## Punk Process

We focus on three data elements:

<h4>Pragmatic Architecture</h4>

<p>We balance your organization's desires, potential funder's desires, and reality.</p>

</div>
<div class="w3-container w3-card-4 spacer-small" style="background: #505050">

<h4>Streamlined Collection</h4>

<p>Data shouldn't be a chore. Using Microsoft PowerApps, we make phone/tablet/web-browser data entry apps that build habits by skipping confusing interfaces.</p>

</div>

<h4>Loud Visualizations</h4>

<p>Engage your staff with a database that isn't a black box. From internal reports to public mobile-responsive visualizations, your data has never been so exposed.</p>

</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">and it's done with <span style="color: #23eeec;">transparent technology</span></p>

Microsoft has done the hard-work, we just mould it to your organization. No algorithmic wizardry required. If you like, we can build your organization's capacity to customize and maintain it. You feeling techie, punk?
