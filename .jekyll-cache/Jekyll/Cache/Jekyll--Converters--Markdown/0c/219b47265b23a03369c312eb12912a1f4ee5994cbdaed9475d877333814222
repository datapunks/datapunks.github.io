<h2>Our Process &amp; Technology:</h2>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of options when it comes to data systems. Weâ€™ve tried them. In recent years, Microsoft has created some fantastic tools in addition to the free software your organization might already be utilizing.</p>

<p>While there is no one solution for everybody, weâ€™ve found the Microsoft ecosystem works great for our sector for a few reasons:</p>

<h2>1: Planning &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>With your help, weâ€™ll help draw up a unique data architecture that generates credible, actionable, and responsible data to forward your goals. Weâ€™ll create the resulting relational data architecture in Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based Common Data Service and import any previous data.</p>

<h2 class="line">2: Prototype, Iterate, Implement</h2>
<p>Technology works better when itâ€™s been co-created. Through our immersive process, weâ€™ll shadow, sketch, and prototype alongside the staff to use the technology, ensuring a tailored fit. We create personalized apps on Microsoftâ€™s PowerApps platform, for its deep customization and cross-device functionality.</p>

<h2 class="line">3: Reporting</h2>
<p>Data is only as useful as it is visible. Luckily, our reports made in PowerBI are highly interactive, colourful, and full of insights. Quickly grab demographics for reports, or get a broader sense of how participants utilize your organization and the stories it creates.</p>
