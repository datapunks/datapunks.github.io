Hey! I'm David.

I help social-change organizations make statements with data, from collection to visualization.

I believe data is story-telling, and if you give staff the right tools, they'll buy in.

My time bike-camping has taught me less is more. A high-quality stream of essential data will do wonders for your organization's ability to advocate with data.

I take issue with the current state of technology's user experience in the social sector.

I want to work with people who have something to say, but no data to say it with.




Datapunks is David Woodruff, an Canadian with an interest in helping social-change organizations get the data they need to make a statement.
